Open a terminal with activate conda env

1. pip install streamlit

2. RUN  jupyter-notebook, it will create mlflow folder and log the model and params

3. To run MLFLOW Server:,  use following command, this is to change the state of the model from stage to production:

	mlflow server    -p 5002 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlruns.db  --default-artifact-root s3://my-mlflow-bucket/

4. Then we can Serve the above registered model by running following: ( you can either put this in a bash file and run bash serve_ml_model.sh), or:

	 export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///mlruns.db

	mlflow models serve -m "models:/ElasticnetWineModel/Production"

This will run the model as an api, on localhost:5000
